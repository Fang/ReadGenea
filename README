Build instructions (for windows):

Get R and Rtools from:
http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/bin/windows/

Install them. (Do NOT install R to C:/Program Files !!!)

Run cmd.exe to start a command prompt.
cd  to whereever the package root 'ReadGenea' folder was extracted.

To build for windows, run:
C:\R2141\bin\x64\Rcmd.exe INSTALL --build --clean ReadGenea 

(Or its equivalent, depending on where R is installed)

This creates a file that you can install into R with Packages>Install packages from local zip file, and load with library(ReadGenea)

To build for linux, run:
C:\R2141\bin\x64\Rcmd.exe build ReadGenea
